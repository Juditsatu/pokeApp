# Pokemon App

The Pokemon App is an Angular application that uses the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) to load and filter through Pokemon Cards. This is Challenge #4 from [NUWE's IT Academy - Lliga de Programaci√≥](https://nuwe.io/event/it-academy-liga-de-programacion).

## :wrench: **Tech used in this project**

In this project I used Angular and Boostrap5 to develop a web app that initially loads 24 Pokemon Cards with Angular's Http Client and upon clicking any of the cards the user is presented with basic stats, specie's information, and evolution chain of the chosen Pokemon. The front page allows users to search by name of the loaded Pokemon. The background color of the cards as well as the border colors of the tags correspond to the 20 different pokemon types with Angular's NG class directive and conditional styling. The site is fully-responsive through the use of Bootstrap5 breakpoints.

## :mortar_board: **What did I learn from this project**

To use and understand an API with nested urls. To understand how to display various properties, since the pokemon API has a lot of information. I have required the use of different functions to get the correct data. Some by using loops to access the properties in the array. Each filter and search process is implemented in the different components, using the Angular services to share data.

## :memo: **What do I still need to do**

1. Functional filtering through type tags.

2. Dynamic search.

3. Pagination or Load More trough lazy load.

4. Design and style the app.
